# Tools

The core of Moulti is and remains a general-purpose CLI-driven TUI.
If you jump straight to the [Documentation](documentation.md) section, you will learn how [moulti run](subcommands.md#run) makes it possible to [script](shell-scripting.md) Moulti.
But first, have a look at a few practical tools based on and shipped along with Moulti:

- an [Ansible plugin](ansible.md) that makes it a pleasure to wait until your Ansible playbooks have finished running
- a [diff](diff.md) subcommand that turns [unified diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format) chunks into Moulti steps
- a [moulti-man](manpage.md) wrapper that lets you read [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) in Moulti
